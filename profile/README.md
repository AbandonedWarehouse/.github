# Abandoned Warehouse!

Okay, big enough for an introduction. Now who manages this org and why does it exist?

Yes, it's me, [Andy Nguyen](https://github.com/aervnu). I manage this org, and so far the only member has been me. This is where my past software projects go after they're no longer in active development and are publicly archived. You can do whatever you want with the code, but if anything happens I am not liable. At all.

I don't plan to expand this org to host more archived projects for now, but I might consider that in the future. Who knows.

Should you have any inquiry or concern, contact me through the org email. 

Well, that's it. Have fun.
